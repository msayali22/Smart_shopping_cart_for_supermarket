Smart Shopping cart

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

An automated smart shopping system is formed by introducing the concept of IoT to connect all items in the supermarket. In this system, an inexpensive RFID tag is embedded within each product. When the product is placed into a smart cart, the product detail is automatically read by the cart equipped with an RFID reader.
